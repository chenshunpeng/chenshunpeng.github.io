# The Name

I named this website "A Finger Pointing to the Moon", as in the Buddhism story:

> **佛告阿难。汝等尚以缘心听法。此法亦缘。非得法性。**
>
> **若复观指以为月体。此人岂唯亡失月轮。亦亡其指。何以故。以所标指为明月故。**
>
> **岂唯亡指。亦复不识明之与暗。何以故。即以指体。为月明性。明暗二性。无所了故。**

Which has been beautifully put by Bruce Lee:

>It's like a finger pointing away to the moon. Don't concentrate on the finger or you will all that heavenly glory.
